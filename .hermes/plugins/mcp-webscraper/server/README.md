## ⚙️ Claude Desktop Configuration

For Windows Users with WSL

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```
File -> Settings -> Edit Config
```

2. Add the WebScrappingServer configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "WebScrapingServer": {
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "-d",
        "Ubuntu",
        "bash",
        "-lc",
        "cd ~/path/to/mcp-webscraper && uv run --with mcp[cli] mcp run scrapping.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace ~/path/to/mcp-webscraper with the actual path to your project folder in WSL.
To find your WSL path:

```bash
pwd
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the 🔌 icon in the text input area
4. Click it to verify "WebScrapingServer" appears

### 🔧 Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

#### Basic Scraping

```bash
"Scrape the homepage of example.com and tell me what you find"
```

#### Advanced SEO analysis

```bash
Please help me to crawl my personal blog https://yourblog.com with a limit of 150 pages.
I would like to understand how articles are referring to each other.
Can you help me to perform this type of analysis?
```

### 🛠️ Available MCP Tools

The server exposes these tools to Claude:

- `scrape_url`: Get raw HTML from any webpage
- `extract_data`: Extract multiple elements using CSS selectors
- `extract_first`: Get a single element from a page
- `batch_scrape`: Process multiple URLs
- `crawl_website`: Discover and map website structure

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in Claude

\*If the server does not appear in Claude, try first to restart Claude Desktop by terminating its processus.`

If this does not work, try to

1. Check the log file:

```
cat scraping_server.log
```

2. Verify the path in config matches your WSL path:

```
pwd
```

The output should match what you have in your config file.

3. Test the server directly:

```bash
uv run python scrapping.py
```

### Playwright issues

If JavaScript scraping fails, try to reinstall the browser

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
```

### WSL-specific issues

Ensure WSL2 is properly installed:

Run this in Windows PowerShell opened as Administrator

```bash
wsl --status
```
